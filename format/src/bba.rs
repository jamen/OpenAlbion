/// I believe I cracked the format for animations a while ago. If I remember correctly it was a quaternion based system.
///
/// Lets start it off simple. CAppearanceDef application, first off what does this do? It basically is the list of animations the hero users when called upon. This is essentially how I created the "Piss" Expression, you could change animation IDs for say when your hero runs with a large sword, add jumps etc... This Cdef couldn't be done with the xml so something custom was made.
